      <p class="small"><strong>Effective date:</strong> {{EFFECTIVE_DATE}}</p>
      <p>Welcome to <strong>{{COMPANY_NAME}}</strong> ("we", "us", "our"). We provide a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform that analyzes sales and inventory data for ecommerce stores (including but not limited to Shopify, Amazon, WooCommerce, and other platforms). This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, your options, and how we protect that information.</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect two categories of information: <strong>Account & contact data</strong> and <strong>Store & analytics data</strong>.</p>

      <h3>1.1 Account & Contact Data</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Full name, business name, email address, phone number (if provided), billing information required to process payments.</li>
        <li>Support correspondence (emails, chat transcripts) and usage of support features.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1.2 Store & Analytics Data</h3>
      <p>To provide analytics, we access the ecommerce data you explicitly connect or upload to our platform. This may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Orders, order items, order status, order timestamps</li>
        <li>Product catalog, SKU, price, inventory levels, stock changes</li>
        <li>Sales channels, marketplace IDs, shipping and fulfillment metadata</li>
        <li>Basic customer data necessary for analytics (name, email, shipping country) — we do not use or expose sensitive personal data beyond necessary analytics.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How We Obtain Data</h2>
      <p>We obtain store data when you (or an authorized user) connect your ecommerce platform account via an API integration (for example Shopify OAuth, Amazon Selling Partner API), or when you upload CSV/Excel files or connect third-party analytics tools. You must have the rights/consent to permit us to access any connected store account.</p>

      <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide, maintain, and improve our analytics, dashboards, and forecasting features.</li>
        <li>Generate reports and alerts (inventory alerts, revenue dips, demand forecasts).</li>
        <li>Process billing and communicate about your account, invoices, and support requests.</li>
        <li>Aggregate anonymized data to improve machine learning models and product features (never exposing identifiable client/store data).</li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Legal Basis (for users in the EU)</h2>
      <p>If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), we rely on the following legal bases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance of a contract</strong>: to provide the SaaS service you signed up for.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong>: to improve service reliability, detect abuse, and for security.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent</strong>: where required (e.g., certain marketing communications or analytics cookies).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal data. We disclose data only as described below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers / Subprocessors:</strong> We share data with vendors who help operate our service (hosting, payment processors, email delivery, analytics). These vendors are bound by contract to process data only on our instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrations:</strong> When you link a platform (e.g., Shopify, Amazon), data flows between that platform and our service; such platforms may also have their own policies.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance & Safety:</strong> We may disclose information to comply with laws, enforce our Terms, respond to legal requests, or to protect rights and safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, user data may be transferred as part of the transaction (with notice when required).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Third-Party Platforms & Tools</h2>
      <p>We may connect to or rely on third-party platforms and tools such as ecommerce APIs (Shopify, Amazon), payment processors (Stripe, PayPal), cloud hosting (AWS, GCP), and analytics providers. Each third party has its own privacy policies — you should review them before connecting. We only request permissions necessary to deliver the analytics features.</p>

      <h2>7. Cookies & Tracking</h2>
      <p>We use cookies and similar technologies for session management, analytics, and to improve user experience. You can control cookie preferences via your browser; some features of our service may require cookies to function.</p>

      <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We retain your account and store data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the service. If you request deletion, we will delete or anonymize active personal data within a reasonable timeframe, except where we are required to retain certain data for legal, tax, or dispute-resolution reasons.</p>

      <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
      <p>We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect data. These include encrypted data transit (TLS), access controls, and regular security reviews. However, no system is 100% secure — if we discover a data breach, we will follow applicable law and notify affected users where required.</p>

      <h2>10. International Transfers</h2>
      <p>Our systems and subprocessors may be located in multiple countries. By using our service, you agree that your data can be transferred and processed in countries that may have different data protection laws than your country. For EEA residents we use standard contractual clauses or other lawful transfer mechanisms where required.</p>

      <h2>11. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Subject to local laws, you may have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access: request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
        <li>Rectification: correct inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
        <li>Deletion: request deletion of personal data (account termination will typically trigger deletion or anonymization of store data as described above).</li>
        <li>Portability: request a machine-readable copy of personal data you provided.</li>
        <li>Objection/Restriction: object to or request restriction of certain processing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:{{PRIVACY_CONTACT_EMAIL}}">{{PRIVACY_CONTACT_EMAIL}}</a>. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling a request.</p>

      <h2>12. Children</h2>
      <p>Our service is not intended for individuals under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete it.</p>

      <h2>13. California Residents (CCPA/CPRA)</h2>
      <p>If you are a California resident, you may have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), including the right to know, delete, and opt out of sale/sharing of personal information. We do not sell personal information as defined under the CCPA. To exercise your rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:{{PRIVACY_CONTACT_EMAIL}}">{{PRIVACY_CONTACT_EMAIL}}</a>.</p>

      <h2>14. Data Access & Deletion for Connected Stores</h2>
      <p>If you connected a store (Shopify, Amazon, etc.), you can disconnect the store at any time from within your account settings. Disconnecting stops further data syncs; you can also request complete deletion of previously synced data by contacting us. Note: deleting data may permanently remove historical analytics and reports.</p>

      <h2>15. Payments & Billing</h2>
      <p>We use third-party payment processors to handle billing. We do not store full payment card numbers on our servers. Payment processors have their own privacy policies — please consult them for details.</p>

      <h2>16. International Customers & Compliance</h2>
      <p>Customers located outside of our home country should be aware that we process and store data in locations where our servers and subprocessors operate. You consent to transfer, storing, and processing data in those locations as necessary to provide the service.</p>

      <h2>17. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. When we make material changes we will post a prominent notice on our website or send an email to affected users. The "Effective date" at the top indicates when this policy was last updated.</p>

      <h2>18. Contact Us</h2>
      <p>If you have questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or your data, contact us:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:{{PRIVACY_CONTACT_EMAIL}}">{{PRIVACY_CONTACT_EMAIL}}</a></li>

      </ul>

      <div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This document is a general privacy template and does not constitute legal advice. Depending on your location, customers' locations, and the specific integrations you support (e.g., Amazon SP-API, Shopify, payment processors), you may need to customize the policy and consult a lawyer to ensure compliance with applicable laws (GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, local consumer protection laws).</div>
